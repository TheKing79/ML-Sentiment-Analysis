📚 **Description**
---

 This project is a Text classification Project based Using Huggingface🤗 pretrained Models.
 In this project, we finetuned a hugging face text classification model to determine covid vaccine tweet sentiments.

🔧 **Installation**
-----------------
To get started , follow these installation steps:
```bash
# setup the environment on windows by running the following code.
python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -r requirements.txt  

#On Linux
python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -r requirements.txt 

```
The Two commands are of the same structure
1.Activate the python environment
2.Upgrade pip to it current version
3.install the requirements located in requirements.txt: You should be at the root of your env

run streamlit src/streamlit app/app.py


🚀 **Usage**
-----------------
This app has been deployed on Huggingface🤗 cloud platform. To see how it works
access it [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/KingAsiedu/sentiment)

To create this project yourself follow these steps
1. Create a huggingface Account [here](https://huggingface.co)

2.Go to src and load the finetuned notebook: upload this notebook to [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

3.Using a GPU run the cells in the notebook login section, go to your hugging face profile and and create a write access token paste this token at the notebook login session

4.The model will be pushed to your huggingface account
